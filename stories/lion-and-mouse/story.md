# The Lion and the Mouse

A lion was resting under a tree, warm sunlight on his mane.

A little mouse, busy as a raindrop, scampered across the ground and—by accident—over the lion’s paw.

The lion’s eyes snapped open.

He lifted one huge paw and pinned the mouse gently, like a heavy blanket.

“Who dares wake me?” the lion rumbled.

The mouse trembled, but she spoke anyway.

“I’m sorry,” she squeaked. “I didn’t mean to. Please let me go. One day I might help you.”

The lion stared.

Help *him*?

The idea was so silly that it made him laugh—a deep laugh that shook the leaves.

“Very well,” he said. “Go on, little one.”

The mouse dashed away, relieved and grateful.

Days later, the forest sounded wrong.

The lion heard a sharp snap, then felt a rope tighten around him.

A hunter’s net had fallen, tangling his legs and pulling him down.

The lion struggled.

The net only hugged tighter.

He roared—once, twice—until his throat hurt.

And then he heard a tiny voice.

“Lion?”

The mouse appeared from the grass.

“I heard you,” she said. “Hold still. I can fix this.”

The lion wanted to argue.

But the net was stronger than his pride.

So he stayed as still as he could.

The mouse set to work, nibbling one knot, then another.

Thread by thread, the net loosened.

When the last rope snapped free, the lion stood up, astonished.

He looked down at the little mouse.

“You did it,” he said quietly.

The mouse smiled.

“Told you,” she said. “Small doesn’t mean useless.”

The lion bowed his head.

And from that day on, when he heard small footsteps in the grass, he listened—because he remembered that kindness can travel in any size.
