# The Tortoise and the Hare

The hare liked to talk about speed.

He talked about it the way some people talk about sunshine—as if it was proof that he was special.

“One hop and I’m over here,” he’d say.

“Two hops and I’m over there.”

He’d grin at the tortoise, who was always, calmly, in the middle of getting somewhere.

One morning the hare declared, “I could race anyone in this forest and win.”

The tortoise looked up.

“I’ll race you,” he said.

The forest got very quiet.

The hare blinked. Then he burst out laughing.

“You?” he said. “You’ll still be at the starting line when I’m eating dinner.”

The tortoise didn’t argue.

He simply nodded.

So they chose a path—from the big oak tree to the river stone—and the other animals gathered to watch.

“Ready?” called the narrator of the forest—an old crow with a loud voice.

“Go!”

The hare exploded forward.

He didn’t run; he *flew*.

In a blink he was far ahead.

He looked back and saw the tortoise, still walking, one careful step after another.

The hare yawned.

“This will take forever,” he said.

He found a patch of soft grass.

“I’ll rest my eyes for a minute,” he decided.

The sun felt warm.

The grass felt cool.

And the hare’s minute became a nap.

Meanwhile, the tortoise kept going.

He didn’t hurry.

He didn’t stop.

He just kept choosing the next step.

By the time the hare woke up, the light had shifted.

He sprang up, startled, and sprinted.

But when he reached the river stone, he saw the tortoise already there—breathing steadily, eyes bright.

The hare slowed.

He didn’t look angry.

He looked surprised.

And maybe, a little wiser.

The tortoise smiled.

“Fast is nice,” he said. “But finishing is nicer.”
