# Maris and the Lighthouse

Maris liked places that had a sound.

The beach had the hush of waves, the dunes had the whisper of grass, and the old wooden boardwalk had a gentle creak that sounded like it remembered everyone who had ever walked across it.

But her favorite sound was the lighthouse.

On clear nights it spoke in a slow rhythm: **turn… glow… rest…**

Maris would sit on the sand and count the pauses between the beams. She didn’t count to keep track of time. She counted to feel steady.

Tonight the wind was busy, tugging at her jacket and scattering her thoughts.

She had walked a little farther than usual—past the tide pools, past the driftwood that looked like a sleeping dragon, and into a stretch of beach where the sand was smooth and empty.

When she finally turned around, the boardwalk lights were small.

Her stomach tightened.

Maris took a breath.

“Okay,” she told herself, softly. “We’ll do this the lighthouse way.”

She looked up.

The lighthouse beam swept across the water and touched the shore—just for a moment—like a hand placed gently on her shoulder.

Maris tried to listen for its rhythm.

But the clouds had thickened, and the light looked fuzzy. The pauses felt different.

Maris blinked.

She was about to panic when she noticed something new: a small bell mounted on a post near the dunes. A sign beneath it read:

**RING FOR HELP.**

Maris reached out… then stopped.

What if she didn’t need help yet?

She sat down in the sand, crossed her arms, and watched the lighthouse again.

**Turn… glow… rest…**

She realized she had been trying to *force* the rhythm to be perfect.

But the lighthouse didn’t force anything.

It turned no matter what the wind did.

It shone no matter what the clouds thought.

It rested without feeling guilty.

Maris exhaled.

She picked one thing she could trust: the direction the beam came from.

Every time the light swept over her, she could see the lighthouse’s shadowed tower for a heartbeat.

She stood.

“Thank you,” she whispered—because it felt right to say it.

Then she walked.

Not fast.

Not frantic.

Just steady.

When the beam touched the sand, she paused and checked: *Am I still walking toward where the light comes from?*

And when the beam moved on, she took another few steps.

After a while the boardwalk lights grew larger, like they were leaning toward her.

A familiar shape appeared ahead: the driftwood dragon.

Maris smiled.

She was back in the part of the beach she knew.

The wind was still busy, but her thoughts weren’t scattered anymore.

At the steps to the boardwalk, Maris turned and looked one last time.

The lighthouse turned.

It glowed.

It rested.

And somehow, it felt like it had been listening the whole time.

Maris went home with sand on her shoes and a new idea in her pocket:

When things feel fuzzy, don’t force the rhythm.

Pick one true direction.

And keep going—slowly, kindly, steadily—until the familiar lights return.
